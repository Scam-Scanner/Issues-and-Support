**Disclaimer of Warranties**

The Bot is provided strictly on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Use of the Service is at Users’ own risk. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Owner expressly disclaims all conditions, representations, and
warranties — whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, any implied warranty of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights. No advice or information,
whether oral or written, obtained by the user from the owner or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly
stated herein.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Owner, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, officers, directors, agents,
co-branders, partners, suppliers, and employees do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable, or correct; that
the Service will meet Users’ requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location,
uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses or other
harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded to users
own risk and users shall be solely responsible for any damage to Users’ computer system or mobile device or loss of data
that results from such download or Users’ use of the Service.

The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or
offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and the Owner shall not be a party
to or in any way monitor any transaction between Users and third-party providers of products or services.

The Service may become inaccessible, or it may not function properly with Users’ web browsers, mobile devices, and/or
operating systems. The owner cannot be held liable for any perceived or actual damages arising from Service content,
operation, or use of this Service.

Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied
warranties. The above exclusions may not apply to Users. This Agreement gives Users specific legal rights, and Users may
also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement shall not
apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

**Limitations of liability**

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates,
officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers, and employees are liable for

* any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages
  for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or
  inability to use, the Service; and
* any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Service or
  User account or the information contained therein;
* any errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content;
* personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from User access to or use of the Service;
* any unauthorized access to or use of the Owner’s secure servers and/or all personal information stored
  therein;

* any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the Service;
* any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content
  posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Service; and/or
* the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any User or third party. In no event shall the Owner, and its
  subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers, and employees are liable for
  any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount paid by
  User to the Owner hereunder in the preceding 12 months, or the period of duration of this agreement between the Owner
  and User, whichever is shorter.
* This limitation of liability section shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction
  whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if
  company has been advised of the possibility of such damage.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, therefore the above
limitations or exclusions may not apply to the User. The terms give the User specific legal rights, and the User may also have other
rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under the
terms shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

**Indemnification**

The User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents,
co-branders, partners, suppliers, and employees harmless from and against all claims or demands, damages,
obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses, including, but not limited to, legal fees and expenses,
arising from

* User’s use of and access to the Service, including any data or content transmitted or received by User;
* User’s violation of these terms, including, but not limited to, User’s breach of the representations and warranties
  outlined in these terms;

  employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.

**Common provisions**

**No Waiver**

The Owner’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any such right
or provision. No waiver shall be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.

**Service interruption**

To ensure the best possible service level, the Owner reserves the right to interrupt the Service for maintenance, system
updates or any other changes, informing the Users appropriately.

Within the limits of the law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or terminate the Service altogether. If the Service is
terminated, the Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw Personal Data or information in accordance
with applicable law.

Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons outside the Owner’s reasonable control, such as “force
majeure” (e.g. labor actions, infrastructural breakdowns or blackouts, etc.).

**Service reselling**

Users may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Bot and its Service without the
Owner’s express prior written permission, granted either directly or through a legitimate reselling program.

**Privacy policy**

To learn more about the use of their Personal Data, Users may refer to the [privacy policy of the Bot](https://github.com/Bluesy1/ScamScanner/blob/master/Privacy%20Policy.md).

**Intellectual property rights**

Without prejudice to any more specific provision of these Terms, any intellectual property rights, such as copyrights,
trademark rights, patent rights and design rights related to the Bot are the exclusive property of the Owner or its
licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties relating to
intellectual property.

All trademarks — nominal or figurative — and all other marks, trade names, service marks, wordmarks, illustrations,
images or logos appearing in connection with the Bot are, and remain, the exclusive property of the Owner or its
licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties related to intellectual
property.

**Changes to these Terms**

The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these Terms at any time. In such cases, the Owner will
appropriately inform the User of these changes.

Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User in the future.

The continued use of the Service will signify the User’s acceptance of the revised Terms. If Users do not wish to be
bound by the changes, they must stop using the Service. Failure to accept the revised Terms may entitle either party to
terminate the Agreement.

The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to the User's acceptance. The User can obtain any
previous version from the Owner.

If required by applicable law, the Owner will specify the date by which the modified Terms will enter into force.

**Assignment of contract**

The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by novation, or subcontract any or all rights or
obligations under these Terms, taking the User’s legitimate interests into account. Provisions regarding changes to
these Terms will apply accordingly.

Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations under these Terms in any way, without the written
permission of the Owner.

**Contacts**

All communications relating to the use of the Bot must be sent using the contact information stated in this document.

**Severability**

Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or
the unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full
force and effect.

**US Users**

Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed, and reformed to the extent reasonably
required to render it valid, enforceable, and consistent with its original intent. These Terms constitute the entire
Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject hereof, and supersede all other communications,
including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties with respect to such subject. These Terms will be
enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

**EU Users**

Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid, or unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to
find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or
unenforceable parts. In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the
applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.

Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity, or the impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these
Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such
the importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be
valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.

**Governing law**

These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is based, as disclosed in the relevant section of this
the document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

**Exception for European Consumers**

However, regardless of the above, if the User qualifies as a European Consumer and has their habitual residence in a
country, where the law provides for a higher consumer protection standard, much higher standards, shall prevail.

**Venue of jurisdiction**

The exclusive competence to decide on any controversy resulting from or connected to these Terms lies with the courts of
the place where the Owner is based, as displayed in the relevant section of this document.

**Exception for European Consumers**

The above does not apply to any Users that qualify as European Consumers, nor to Consumers based in Switzerland, Norway
or Iceland.

**Dispute resolution**

**Amicable dispute resolution**

Users may bring any disputes to the Owner who will try to resolve them amicably.

While Users' right to take legal action shall always remain unaffected, in the event of any controversy regarding the
use of the Bot or the Service, Users are kindly asked to contact the Owner at the contact details provided in this
document.

The User may submit the complaint including a brief description and if applicable, the details of the related order,
purchase, or account, to the Owner’s email address specified in this document.

The Owner will process the complaint without undue delay and within 21 days of receiving it.

**Online dispute resolution for Consumers**

The European Commission has established an online platform for alternative dispute resolutions that facilitates an
out-of-court method for solving any dispute related to and stemming from online sale and service contracts.

As a result, any European Consumer can use such a platform for resolving any dispute stemming from contracts that have
been entered into online. The platform is [available at the following link](http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/).
